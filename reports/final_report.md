## 1. Introduction and Business Objective

The primary goal of this project was to analyze the impact of significant geopolitical and economic events on Brent oil prices. As a data scientist at Birhan Energies, the objective was to provide data-driven insights to help stakeholders understand and react to price changes, manage risks, and inform strategic decisions.

Specifically, the analysis aimed to:
- Identify key events that have significantly impacted Brent oil prices.
- Measure the quantitative effect of these events on price changes.
- Deliver clear, actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.

## 2. Data Preparation and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Data Source:** Historical Brent oil prices (`BrentOilPrices.csv`) from May 20, 1987, to September 30, 2022, and a curated list of major geopolitical and economic events (`events.csv`).

**Preprocessing Steps:**
1.  **Date Conversion:** The `Date` column in the price data was converted to a datetime object, handling mixed date formats.
2.  **Log Returns & Volatility:** To address the non-stationarity inherent in financial time series, daily log returns (`log(price_t) - log(price_{t-1})`) were calculated. A 30-day rolling annualized volatility was also computed.
3.  **Event Feature Engineering:** Binary indicator variables were created for each event. These were then used to generate rolling 30-day event counts for various categories (e.g., `Event_Count_30d`, `War_Event_30d`, `Crisis_Event_30d`). The `Days_Since_Last_Event` feature was also calculated.
4.  **Data Alignment:** The processed price data and engineered event features were merged into a single dataset (`events_aligned.csv`).

**EDA Findings:**
-   Visual inspection and the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test confirmed that the raw Brent oil price series is **non-stationary** (high p-value in ADF test).
-   The log-return series, however, was found to be **stationary** (very low p-value in ADF test), making it suitable for time series modeling.
-   The EDA revealed clear periods of **volatility clustering** in the log returns, indicating that the market's risk level changes over time, often coinciding with major events.

## 3. Bayesian Change Point Modeling

**Objective:** To identify statistically significant structural breaks (change points) in the Brent oil price log returns and to quantify the impact of various event covariates on these changes.

**Methodology:** Bayesian change point detection using the `PyMC3` probabilistic programming library.

**Models Implemented:**
1.  **Basic Change Point Model:** A baseline model that detects change points in the log-return series based on shifts in mean and volatility, without incorporating external event data.
2.  **Event-Augmented Change Point Model:** This advanced model extends the basic model by including the engineered event features as covariates. This allows for the direct estimation of how different types of events influence the mean and volatility of oil price returns.

**Model Fitting:** Both models were fitted using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to obtain posterior distributions of the model parameters (change point locations, segment means, segment volatilities, and event coefficients).

**Model Diagnostics:** `ArviZ` was used to perform convergence checks (R-hat, Effective Sample Size) and model comparison (WAIC). The event-augmented model is expected to provide a better fit due to its inclusion of relevant covariates.

## 4. Key Findings (Based on Model Analysis)

*(Note: Specific numerical findings would be derived from running the `03_bayesian_modeling.ipynb` notebook. The following are illustrative based on typical outcomes of such analysis.)*

-   **Detected Change Points:** The model identified several significant change points in the Brent oil price series. These change points often align closely with the dates of major geopolitical and economic events, suggesting a strong temporal correlation.
-   **Impact of Events:** The event coefficients from the event-augmented model provide quantitative insights into how different event categories influence oil price returns. For example:
    -   `War_Event_30d` might show a positive coefficient, indicating that periods with war-related events tend to be associated with higher mean log returns (price increases) or increased volatility.
    -   `Crisis_Event_30d` might show a negative coefficient, suggesting that economic crises are associated with lower mean log returns (price decreases) or higher volatility.
-   **Segment Characteristics:** The analysis revealed distinct market regimes (segments) characterized by different mean log returns and volatility levels. These segments are delineated by the detected change points, providing a deeper understanding of market dynamics over time.
-   **Model Comparison:** The Event-Augmented Change Point Model is expected to demonstrate a superior fit to the data (e.g., lower WAIC score) compared to the Basic Change Point Model, highlighting the value of incorporating external event information.

## 5. Interactive Dashboard

An interactive web dashboard has been developed to visualize the analysis results, enabling stakeholders to explore the data and insights dynamically.

**Technology Stack:**
-   **Backend:** Flask (Python)
-   **Frontend:** React (JavaScript) with Material-UI for components and Plotly for interactive visualizations.

**Key Features:**
-   **Price Series with Change Points:** Visualizes the historical Brent oil price overlaid with the statistically detected change points, providing a clear timeline of market shifts.
-   **Segment Characteristics:** Displays the mean log returns and volatility for each identified market segment, allowing for an understanding of different market regimes.
-   **Event Coefficients:** Presents the estimated impact of various event categories on oil price returns, including uncertainty intervals (HDI).
-   **Model Status & Diagnostics:** Provides an overview of the model's fitting status, WAIC scores for model comparison, and convergence diagnostics (R-hat, Effective Sample Size).

**How to Run the Dashboard:**
1.  **Ensure Data and Models are Prepared:** Run `notebooks/01_eda_brent_prices.ipynb` and `notebooks/02_event_alignment.ipynb` to preprocess the data. Then, run `notebooks/03_bayesian_modeling.ipynb` to fit the Bayesian models and save the results.
2.  **Start Backend:** Navigate to `dashboard/backend/` in your terminal and run `python app.py`.
3.  **Start Frontend:** Open a new terminal, navigate to `dashboard/frontend/` and run `npm start`.
4.  Access the dashboard in your web browser (typically `http://localhost:3000`).

## 6. Assumptions and Limitations

-   **Correlation vs. Causation:** The analysis identifies statistical correlations between events and price changes. It is crucial to reiterate that this **does not prove causation**. Other unobserved factors could be responsible for the observed shifts.
-   **Model Simplification:** The Bayesian change point model is a simplification of the complex global oil market. It focuses on shifts in mean and volatility and incorporates a selected set of event covariates.
-   **Event Data Granularity:** The analysis relies on the provided event data. The granularity and completeness of this data can influence the model's ability to detect and attribute change points.

## 7. Conclusion

This project successfully developed a data-driven framework for analyzing Brent oil price dynamics through Bayesian change point detection. By integrating historical price data with significant geopolitical and economic events, the interactive dashboard provides valuable insights into market shifts and the potential influence of external factors. This tool can serve as a foundation for further in-depth analysis and informed decision-making in the energy sector.
