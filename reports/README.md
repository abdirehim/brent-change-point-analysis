## File Naming Convention

- Reports: `YYYY-MM-DD_report_type.pdf`
- Presentations: `YYYY-MM-DD_presentation_type.pptx`
- Use descriptive names that indicate content and date

## Generation

Reports are generated from Jupyter notebooks and analysis scripts:
- Use `nbconvert` to convert notebooks to PDF
- Include all figures, tables, and code outputs
- Ensure reproducibility by including environment details

## Distribution
